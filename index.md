Welcome to the web site for the Nowling Lab at the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu). Our research is focused on the application of machine learning and statistics to genomic data from insect vectors.  Insects present multiple challenges in sequencing, assembly, and analysis that require the development of new tools and approaches.

We aim to provide students with experiences through which they can assess research as a potential career path.  Through our collaborations with faculty at R1 institutions, students are exposed to fields outside of Computer Science, the nature of interdisciplinary work, and research-intensive environments.  Any and all students with a passion for learning and a strong work ethic are welcome regardless of GPA, prior experience, or major.
